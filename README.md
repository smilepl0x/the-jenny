## What this is
The Jenny is a Discord bot that I made for a personal server with some friends, but feel free to spin her up if you think she'd be useful.
## Commands

`/show battletag#id`
 - This will scrape Overwatch data from the Blizzard webpage and display QP stats in a message

`/start game_name`
 - Used for letting the crew know you're starting a game
 - Configs can be added to tag roles for certain games
 - Configs can be added to start the game with an alias (i.e `/start Overwatch` becomes `/start ow`)
 - Configs can be added to limit party size for certain games
 - Configs can be added to close a party after time has elapsed
